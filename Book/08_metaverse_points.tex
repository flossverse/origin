\section{TL;DR}
\textbf{The points below are the tl;dr for the whole book. They do not currently correspond to the order in the book, but will do at some point
\begin{itemize}
\item Metaverse is coming, in some form, at some point. Everyone is positioning in case it's ``soon''.
\item It's not very clear what it is, or if people want it.
\item From a business perspective metaverse is the worst of the remote collaboration toolkits, and undermines productivity
\item It's probably technology for technologies sake to a degree, but the time feels right for the attempt
\item Industry has noted the risk, and failure of Meta in this domain and have latched onto "open metaverse" as a narrative to derisk their interest
\item Anything from a multi-million pound XR studio screen to a speech audio system can be a metaverse interface
\item Constraints (metaverse schema) which are crafted in response to the use case, the interface, and the audience is where challenges are most profound. This is an opportunity.
\item Trust, governance, and safeguarding, are far harder in these realtime distributed social systems
\item There's a bunch of startups and options, and there's interesting work and some adoption but scaling is very hard in the face of tepid consumer interest
\item Industrial interests seem to be missing the point that open metaverse should mean open source metaverse. There are some options, but they are under developed. This is an opportunity
\item There seems to be genuine and undeniable interest in digital scarcity. The ownership of digital goods seems natural to younger digitally native users
\item This is serviced already by various (gaming) platforms, but they are all isolated ecosystems
\item Uniting these attempts with portable "goods" across the digital universe (metaverse) likely requires a global digital ledger (blockchain)
\item Crypto is igniting imagination on this topic, and is seeing adoption both inside out outside of the metaverse contexts
\item Crypto is a nightmare, rife with scams, poor technology choices, limited life, and incorrect assumptions
\item The only thing blockchain/crypto can do well is money, which is a cornerstone of human interaction, and the killer application here
\item There do seem to be better options emerging
\item Money, identity, and thereby trust, can be mediated by the Bitcoin network. This is an opportunity
\item Digital ownership is nearly possible at scale, low cost, and minimal environmental impact, with the Bitcoin network. This is an opportunity
\end{itemize}
