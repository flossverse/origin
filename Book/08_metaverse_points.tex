\section{Summary TL;DR}
\label{sec:tldr}
\begin{itemize}
\item There may be an inflection point in the organisational topology of the internet, because of trust abuses by the incumbent providers. This moment has been calling itself Web3, but the moniker is fraught with problems, and somewhat meaningless. The drivers are real.
\item `The Metaverse' is coming, in some form, at some point. Everyone is positioning in case it's ``soon''. It's not at all clear what it is, or if people want it, but the best emergent narrative seems to be ``digital society'' and that obviously should not be dismissed lightly.
\item Large scale `social' \& immersive metaverse is suffering poor adoption, failing as it has in the past. It's likely that the market need has been overstated. More advanced and popular (closed) games based solutions do not serve societal or business needs.
\item From a business perspective metaverse is the worst of the remote collaboration tool-kits, and undermines flow, productivity, and interpersonal trust. Metaverse is probably technology for technologies sake at this time, but the investment is real. Digital society is more tangible and less hyped, and extends out into the more compelling spatial and augmented reality technologies. This is a good thing!
\item Excluding Facebook/Meta, a lot of the investment is coming from the recent Web3 speculative bubble. They have a parallel and intersectional metaverse narrative, based around distributed financial tooling and digital assets. 
\item There is genuine, undeniable interest in digital scarcity. The ownership of digital goods seems natural to younger, digitally native users. This is serviced already by various (gaming) platforms, but they are all isolated ecosystems.
\item Uniting these attempts, with portable (transferable) ``goods'' across digital society likely requires a global ledger (blockchain), indeed this is the basis of the Web3 interpretation. Crypto is igniting imagination on this topic, and is seeing adoption both inside out outside of the metaverse context.
\item Crypto is a nightmare; rife with scams, poor technology choices, limited life, and incorrect assumptions. The only thing blockchain/crypto can do well is ``money like networks'', which is a cornerstone of human interaction, and the killer application.
\item Representations of dollars and pounds can ride securely on top of such networks as stablecoins, and this is getting easier to integrate, though there are risks. This has the potential to open up global collaborative working practices, inclusive of emerging markets.
\item It's unclear which technology will win, if any, but since the tools exist now they can be integrated and tested immediately. Money, digital asset, identity, and thereby trust, can already be mediated by the Bitcoin network, even without using Bitcoin the asset. This is an opportunity.
\item Legislative and cultural headwinds are significant. There might be no opportunity here in the end, though ``rough game theory'' supports the attempt.
\item Industry has noted the risk, and failures of Meta across both metaverse, and digital currency, and have latched onto "open metaverse" as a narrative, to de-risk their interest. The current open metaverse is muddy and confused. 
\item A truth seems to have been missed; that open metaverse should mean open source metaverse. There are some options, but they are under developed. This is an opportunity.
\item Anything from a multi-million pound XR studio screen, to a speech audio system, can be a digital society interface.
\item AI \& machine learning is further blurring these boundaries. A better term for AI/ML is `supported creativity' and/or `augmented intelligence'.
\item Trust, accessibility, governance, and safeguarding, are hard problems, and made more complex by unrecorded social flow in immersive social VR.
\item A topologically flat, inclusive, permissionless, open metaverse, with economically empowered ML and AI actors, which can mediate governance issues, transparently, according to well constructed custom schemas, between cryptographically verifiable economic users (human or AI) is an opportunity.
\item New open source [supported creativity, augmented intelligence] tooling from StabilityAI potentially removes many of the problems with accessibility, creativity, language barriers, safeguarding, and governance. This is a huge opportunity.
\item Using new image generation ML it may be possible to build a new kind of collaborative global teams for virtual production, ideating in simplistic immersive spaces while instantly creating demonstrable in camera scenes which can be stylised using verbal commands in real-time.
\item Such teams could could be far more ad-hoc by leveraging the designs outlines in this book. This kind of genuine digital society use case is something sorely lacking in large scale attempts such as Meta Horizons. It need not be complex or large scale, but it must be secure, trusted, and task appropriate. We think we can deliver this and conversations with the industry suggest that there is excitement and cautious appetite.
